#Rake My Movies

This is the final project for the CSI2132 - Database I class. 

Our goal was to make a movie rating website similar to rottentomatoes.
We connected our database to the uOttawa server. For the front end we used HTML&CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Knockout and for the BackEnd we used PHP to connect the db with the frontend.
